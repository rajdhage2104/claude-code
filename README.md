# Claude Code Repository

This repository contains basic Python code examples to demonstrate fundamental concepts and patterns.

## Files in this Repository

- `hello_world.py` - A simple script demonstrating basic Python syntax, input/output, conditionals, and loops
- `person.py` - An example class implementation with methods and attributes
- `utils.py` - A collection of utility functions showcasing various Python capabilities

## Usage

You can run any of the Python files directly:

```bash
python hello_world.py
python person.py
python utils.py
```

## Learning Python

These scripts are intended to serve as simple examples for learning Python. Each file includes comments explaining what the code does.

Feel free to modify and experiment with these examples to deepen your understanding of Python programming.

## Next Steps

After understanding these basic examples, you might want to explore:

1. File I/O operations
2. Working with external libraries (e.g., requests, pandas)
3. Error handling with try/except
4. More advanced data structures
5. Building simple web applications with Flask or Django
