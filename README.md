# Claude Code Repository

This repository contains Python code examples to demonstrate fundamental concepts and patterns.

## Files in this Repository

- `hello_world.py` - An interactive script with a menu system demonstrating Python syntax, input/output, conditionals, loops, and utility functions
- `person.py` - An example class implementation with methods and attributes
- `utils.py` - A collection of utility functions showcasing various Python capabilities:
  - Random number generation
  - Date and time formatting
  - Fibonacci sequence calculation
  - Palindrome checking
  - Function execution timing
  - Random password generation

## Usage

You can run any of the Python files directly:

```bash
python hello_world.py
python person.py
python utils.py
```

## Features Added

Recent improvements include:
- Interactive menu system in `hello_world.py`
- Password generation functionality
- Better error handling
- Improved user experience

## Learning Python

These scripts are intended to serve as examples for learning Python. Each file includes comments explaining what the code does.

Feel free to modify and experiment with these examples to deepen your understanding of Python programming.

## Next Steps

After understanding these examples, you might want to explore:

1. File I/O operations
2. Working with external libraries (e.g., requests, pandas)
3. Error handling with try/except
4. More advanced data structures
5. Building simple web applications with Flask or Django
6. Unit testing your code
7. Working with databases (SQLite, PostgreSQL)
8. Creating RESTful APIs
